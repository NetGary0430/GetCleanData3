There are 5 specific directions for the project.  The file run_analysis.R is to do the following:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The Codebook describes the data and how the data the data is processed by the R script.

There is a single script, run_analysis.R that loads the data, massages the data as required by the assignment expectations, and produces the tidy data set.

Note that the script is documented throughout to describe how specific lines of code or sections of code are used.
